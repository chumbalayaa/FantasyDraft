//This file will take in a JSON object of all of
//the players. It will then calculate (given a
//set of rules in the POST request parameter)
//their new projected fantasy points for the season.
//Then, it will calculate their fantasyPositionIndex (FPI)
//which will be used to determine their final ranking. 
//These new attributes will simply be added to the existing
//JSON object that is inputted.
